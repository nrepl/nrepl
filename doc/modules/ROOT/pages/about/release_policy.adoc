= Release Policy

We're following http://semver.org/[SemVer]. Bumps of the minor (second) version
number are considered feature releases and always include new features or
significant changes to existing features. API compatibility will almost never be
broken.footnote:[Unless explicitly stated via deprecation warnings for a few
releases beforehand.]

The development cycle for the next feature
release starts immediately after the previous one has been
shipped. Bugfix/point releases (if any) address only serious bugs and
never contain new features. Here are a few examples:

* 1.0.0 - Feature release
* 1.0.1 - Bug-fix release
* 1.0.2 - Bug-fix release
* 1.1.0 - Feature release
