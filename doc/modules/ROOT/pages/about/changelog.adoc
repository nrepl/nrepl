= Changelog

An extensive changelog is available https://github.com/nrepl/nrepl/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md[here].

The changelog documents only user-visible changes. We take extra care to annotate properly breaking changes (which
are extremely rare in general).

TIP: The information from the changelog is also duplicated in the https://github.com/nrepl/nrepl/releases[release notes].
