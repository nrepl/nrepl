= Compatibility

NOTE: This section applies to most projects in nREPL's GitHub
organization.

== Java

nREPL officially targets LTS releases and the most recent rapid
release version.  More generally speaking - we aim to support all
Java releases that are currently officially supported by Oracle.

This is currently Java 8, 11, and 17.

== Clojure

nREPL targets Clojure 1.7+. As Clojure doesn't have the concept of supported releases
we have to get a bit creative to determine the minimum version to target.

The minimum required Clojure version is currently derived using data
from the
https://clojure.org/news/2021/04/06/state-of-clojure-2021[State of
Clojure] survey. In general we consider a Clojure release eligible for
dropping once its usage drops below 5%, but we'd not drop support for
any release just for the sake of doing it. We'd do it only if
this would lessen the maintenance burden or open up the possibility for
big nREPL improvements.

== Compatibility Matrix

Below you can find the official compatibility matrix for nREPL. For a
very long time the project targeted JDK 5 and Clojure 1.2, but the
requirements were bumped in nREPL 0.4.

== Java 20+ compatibility

In general, nREPL behavior does not depend on the versions of Java and Clojure.
As of now, there is one exception to this rule, see
xref:installation.adoc#jvmti[JVMTI agent] page.

== Backwards Compatibility

IMPORTANT: Given the massive community investment in developing all sorts of
tooling on top of nREPL, nREPL's team pledges to evolve the project only in
a responsible manner and backwards-compatible ways.

It's extremely unlikely that we're going to break compatibility on the
protocol level ever (with the rare cases of changing/removing things
that existed, but we knew for a fact weren't used).  Most often
backwards compatibility would be broken on the implementation level
(usually it's just removal of deprecated functionality).

That would always happen with plenty of lead time and would be annotated
accordingly in the changelog.

IMPORTANT: Features/APIs marked as "Experimental" are subject to changes.
Be mindful of those.
