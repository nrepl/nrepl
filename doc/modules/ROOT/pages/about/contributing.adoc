== Issues

Report issues and suggest features and improvements on the
https://github.com/nrepl/nrepl/issues[GitHub issue tracker]. Don't ask
questions on the issue tracker - use the xref:about/support.adoc[support channels] instead.

If you want to file a bug, please provide all the necessary info listed in
our issue reporting template (it's loaded automatically when you create a
new GitHub issue).

== Patches

Patches in any form are always welcome! GitHub pull requests are even better! :-)

Before submitting a patch or a pull request make sure all tests are
passing and that your patch is in line with the https://github.com/nrepl/nrepl/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md[contribution guidelines].

== Documentation

Good documentation is just as important as good code.

Consider improving and extending this manual.

=== Working on the Docs Site

The https://nrepl.org[documentation site] is generated from the AsciiDoc files in the https://github.com/nrepl/nrepl/tree/master/doc[doc] folder of nREPL's GitHub repo and is published to https://nrepl.org.
https://antora.org[Antora] is used to convert the manual into HTML.
The filesystem layout is described at https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.0/component-structure/.

To make changes to the manual you simply have to change the files under `doc`.
The site will be regenerated manually periodically.

==== Installing Antora

NOTE: The instructions here assume you already have (the right version of) node.js installed.

Installing the Antora is super simple:

[source]
----
$ npm i -g @antora/cli@2.3 @antora/site-generator-default@2.3
----

Check out https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/install/install-antora/[the detailed installation instructions]
if you run into any problems.

==== Building the Site

You can build the documentation locally from the https://github.com/nrepl/nrepl.org[nrepl.org] repo.

[source]
----
$ cd nrepl.org
$ antora --pull antora-playbook.yml
----

After you're done with the initial setup you can use the `deploy` script to push changes to the site:

[source]
----
./deploy
----

NOTE: You'll need commit access to the repository for this to work.

To check the generated site you can simply open `docs/index.html` in your favourite browser.

If you want to make changes to the manual's page structure you'll have to edit
https://github.com/nrepl/nrepl/blob/master/doc/modules/ROOT/nav.adoc[nav.adoc].

==== Testing Local Changes

By default Antora will build the documentation for nREPL's `master` branch and all recent stable
releases by fetching the data from nREPL main GitHub repository.

If you want to check changes you've made locally you'll have to update the `antora-playbook.yml`
file in the `nrepl.org` repository. There you should instruct Antora to build the docs from your
local git repo instead of the main repo on GitHub:

[source,yaml]
----
# you have to change this
content:
   sources:
   - url: https://github.com/nrepl/nrepl.git
     branches: ['master']
     tags: ['0.5.3', '0.6.0', '0.7.0', '0.8.0']

# to something like
content:
   sources:
   - url: /path/to/local/nrepl/clone
     branches: ['issues/207']
     start_path: doc
----

==== Deploying to Clojars

Releases are done by CircleCI automatically. To push a release, you need to tag
a commit in master branch with the desired release version, starting with `v`,
e.g. `v1.2.3`.

== Funding

While nREPL is free software and will always be, the project would benefit immensely from some funding.
Raising a monthly budget of a couple of thousand dollars would make it possible to pay people to work on
certain complex features, fund other development related stuff (e.g. hardware, conference trips) and so on.
Raising a monthly budget of over $5000 would open the possibility of someone working full-time on the project
which would speed up the pace of development significantly.

We welcome both individual and corporate sponsors! We also offer a wide array of funding channels to account
for your preferences (although currently https://opencollective.com/nrepl[Open Collective] is our preferred funding platform).

If you're working in a company that's making significant use of nREPL we'd appreciate it if you suggest to your company
to become a nREPL sponsor.
