= Installation

[NOTE]
====
nREPL is compatible with Clojure 1.7.0+ and Java 8+.
====

nREPL is a library (as opposed to it being an application), so it's
not something you'd be installing in the traditional sense. There's
currently no nREPL binary or script that you can run to spin a server.

[NOTE]
====
While there's no binary, there is a command-line interface that
mostly targets `clj`. It's documented in the subsequent sections of this
manual.
====

All popular Clojure build tools (Leiningen, Gradle, Maven) have
the ability to run an nREPL server and most of the time you'll probably
simply use nREPL through them and end up using whatever nREPL version
they happen to ship.

Still, from time to time you'll be building a tool around nREPL or you'll
want to embed an nREPL server directly in your application. In those
scenarios some kind of an installation will be in order - just adding
nREPL as a dependency to your project.

nREPL is available in Clojars. Add this to your Leiningen
`project.clj` `:dependencies`:

[source,clojure]
----
[nrepl "1.1.2"]
----

[TIP]
====
You can override the version of nREPL supplied by Leiningen by adding nREPL as a
dependency to your project.
====

Or, add this to your Gradle project's `build.gradle`:

[source, groovy]
----
dependencies {
  // to use as a library in your code
  implementation 'nrepl:nrepl:1.1.2'

  // or to override the version of nREPL used by the clojureRepl task
  nrepl 'nrepl:nrepl:1.1.2'
}
----

Or, add this to your Maven project's `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>nrepl</groupId>
  <artifactId>nrepl</artifactId>
  <version>1.1.2</version>
</dependency>

=== Enable libnrepl JVMTI agent

Starting with Java 20, the previously deprecated
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Thread.html#stop()[Thread.stop]
method has been
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/doc-files/threadPrimitiveDeprecation.html[disabled].
This change made it impossible for the xref:ops.adoc#interrupt[interrupt]
middleware to forcibly stop evaluation of forms which don't respond to the
officially endorsed
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Thread.html#interrupt()[Thread.interrupt]
calls. In response, nREPL introduced a native
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/specs/jvmti.html[JVMTI-based]
agent to be able to stop threads on the latest Java again.

nREPL ships with prebuilt JVMTI agent binaries for the following platforms:

- Linux: *x64* and *arm64*
- MacOS: *x64/arm64* (universal binary)

NOTE: Other platforms and architectures not in this list are still supported by
nREPL. Only the thread stopping capability and only on Java 20+ will not work
there, the rest of nREPL functionality will still work as always.

For the JVMTI agent to be able to attach to the running process, the JVM has to
be started with the flag `-Djdk.attach.allowAttachSelf`. Depending on the built
tool, this can be done like this:

- With tools.deps, add `:jvm-opts ["-Djdk.attach.allowAttachSelf"]` to an alias
in `deps.edn` and enable that alias, or add `-J-Djdk.attach.allowAttachSelf`
explicitly to your REPL command.
- With Leiningen, add `:jvm-opts ["-Djdk.attach.allowAttachSelf"]` to
  `project.clj`.

If `-Djdk.attach.allowAttachSelf` is not enabled, nREPL will not try to load the
native agent and will not try to stop threads on Java 20 and newer if the
regular `Thread.interrupt()` did not succeed.

You can explicitly disable the JVMTI agent so that it does not load even with
`-Djdk.attach.allowAttachSelf` enabled. To do that, add this line to
xref:usage/server.adoc#server-configuration[nREPL config]:

[source,clojure]
----
 :enable-jvmti-agent false
----

NOTE: Prior to Java 20, nREPL will not try to load libnrepl native agent
regardless of the state of `-Djdk.attach.allowAttachSelf` flag or
`:enable-jvmti-agent` configuration option, and will use `Thread.stop()` to
interrupt the evaluating thread.
