= Supported nREPL operations

[small]#generated from a verbose 'describe' response (nREPL v0.6.0-SNAPSHOT)#

== Operations

=== `:clone`

Clones the current session, returning the ID of the newly-created session.

Required parameters::
{blank}

Optional parameters::
* `:session` The ID of the session to be cloned; if not provided, a new session with default bindings is created, and mapped to the returned session ID.


Returns::
* `:new-session` The ID of the new session.



=== `:close`

Closes the specified session.

Required parameters::
* `:session` The ID of the session to be closed.


Optional parameters::
{blank}

Returns::
{blank}


=== `:describe`

Produce a machine- and human-readable directory and documentation for the operations supported by an nREPL endpoint.

Required parameters::
{blank}

Optional parameters::
* `:verbose?` Include informational detail for each "op"eration in the return message.


Returns::
* `:aux` Map of auxilliary data contributed by all of the active nREPL middleware via :describe-fn functions in their descriptors.
* `:ops` Map of "op"erations supported by this nREPL endpoint
* `:versions` Map containing version maps (like \*clojure-version*, e.g. major, minor, incremental, and qualifier keys) for values, component names as keys. Common keys include "nrepl" and "clojure".



=== `:eval`

Evaluates code.

Required parameters::
* `:code` The code to be evaluated.
* `:session` The ID of the session within which to evaluate the code.


Optional parameters::
* `:column` The column number in [file] at which [code] starts.
* `:eval` A fully-qualified symbol naming a var whose function value will be used to evaluate [code], instead of ``clojure.core/eval`` (the default).
* `:file` The path to the file containing [code]. ``clojure.core/\*file*`` will be bound to this.
* `:id` An opaque message ID that will be included in responses related to the evaluation, and which may be used to restrict the scope of a later "interrupt" operation.
* `:line` The line number in [file] at which [code] starts.


Returns::
* `:ex` The type of exception thrown, if any. If present, then ``values`` will be absent.
* `:ns` \*ns*, after successful evaluation of ``code``.
* `:root-ex` The type of the root exception thrown, if any. If present, then ``values`` will be absent.
* `:values` The result of evaluating ``code``, often ``read``able. This printing is provided by the ``pr-values`` middleware, and could theoretically be customized. Superseded by ``ex`` and ``root-ex`` if an exception occurs during evaluation.



=== `:interrupt`

Attempts to interrupt some code evaluation.

Required parameters::
* `:session` The ID of the session used to start the evaluation to be interrupted.


Optional parameters::
* `:interrupt-id` The opaque message ID sent with the original "eval" request.


Returns::
* `:status` 'interrupted' if an evaluation was identified and interruption will be attempted
'session-idle' if the session is not currently evaluating any code
'interrupt-id-mismatch' if the session is currently evaluating code sent using a different ID than specified by the "interrupt-id" value 



=== `:load-file`

Loads a body of code, using supplied path and filename info to set source file and line number metadata. Delegates to underlying "eval" middleware/handler.

Required parameters::
* `:file` Full contents of a file of code.


Optional parameters::
* `:file-name` Name of source file, e.g. io.clj
* `:file-path` Source-path-relative path of the source file, e.g. clojure/java/io.clj


Returns::
* `:ex` The type of exception thrown, if any. If present, then ``values`` will be absent.
* `:ns` \*ns*, after successful evaluation of ``code``.
* `:root-ex` The type of the root exception thrown, if any. If present, then ``values`` will be absent.
* `:values` The result of evaluating ``code``, often ``read``able. This printing is provided by the ``pr-values`` middleware, and could theoretically be customized. Superseded by ``ex`` and ``root-ex`` if an exception occurs during evaluation.



=== `:ls-sessions`

Lists the IDs of all active sessions.

Required parameters::
{blank}

Optional parameters::
{blank}

Returns::
* `:sessions` A list of all available session IDs.



=== `:stdin`

Add content from the value of "stdin" to \*in* in the current session.

Required parameters::
* `:stdin` Content to add to \*in*.


Optional parameters::
{blank}

Returns::
* `:status` A status of "need-input" will be sent if a session's \*in* requires content in order to satisfy an attempted read operation.
