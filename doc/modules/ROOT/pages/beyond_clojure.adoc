= Beyond Clojure

As mentioned earlier the nREPL protocol is language-agnostic and can
be leveraged for many languages that have the ability to evaluate code
at runtime.

== Alternative Server Implementations

Those server implementations are developed and
maintained by third-parties (as opposed to nREPL's team), and their
maturity might vary.

NOTE: Certain nREPL clients may make Clojure-specific assumptions which
will cause bugs when used with other servers, while other clients are
designed with language-agnosticism in mind. Usually the nREPL servers would mention in their
documentation which clients are known to work well with them.

* https://gitlab.com/technomancy/jeejah[JeeJah] - an nREPL server for https://fennel-lang.org/[Fennel] and https://www.lua.org/[Lua]

* https://gitlab.com/technomancy/ogion[Ogion] - an nREPL server for https://racket-lang.org/[Racket]

* https://github.com/sjl/cl-nrepl[cl-nrepl] - an nREPL server for Common Lisp

* https://github.com/bodil/cljs-noderepl[cljs-noderepl] - an nREPL server for ClojureScript running on Node.js

* https://github.com/clojure/clr.tools.nrepl[nREPL CLR] - an nREPL server for ClojureCLR. A 1:1 port of the reference Clojure nREPL. Unfortunately it has been abandoned a long time ago.

* https://github.com/arcadia-unity/Arcadia/blob/master/Editor/NRepl.cs[Arcadia nREPL] - an nREPL server implemented in C# for Arcadia. An actively maintained alternative of nREPL CLR.

* https://github.com/babashka/babashka.nrepl[Babashka nREPL] - an nREPL server bundled with https://github.com/borkdude/babashka[babashka]

* https://github.com/djblue/nrepl-cljs[nrepl-cljs] - a native ClojureScript nREPL server implementation

* https://github.com/viesti/nrepl-cljs-sci[nrepl-cljs-sci] - a native Node.js nREPL server implementation using https://github.com/borkdude/sci[SCI].

* https://git.sr.ht/~abcdw/guile-ares-rs[guile-ares-rs] -  an Asynchronous Reliable Extensible Sleek RPC Server for Guile based on the nREPL protocol. 

As you can see nREPL has implementations for many popular Lisp dialects, but it's certainly not limited to Lisp dialects.
