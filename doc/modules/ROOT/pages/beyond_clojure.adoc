= Beyond Clojure

As mentioned earlier the nREPL protocol is language-agnostic and can
be leveraged for many languages that have the ability to evaluate code
at runtime.

== Alternative Server Implementations

Those server implementations are developed and
maintained by third-parties (as opposed to nREPL's team), and their
maturity might vary.

NOTE: Certain nREPL clients may make Clojure-specific assumptions which
will cause bugs when used with other servers, while other clients are
designed with language-agnosticism in mind. Usually the nREPL servers would mention in their
documentation which clients are known to work well with them.

As you can see nREPL has implementations for many popular Lisp dialects, but it's certainly not limited to Lisp dialects.
