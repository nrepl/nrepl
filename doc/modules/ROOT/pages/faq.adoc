== What's the difference between contrib's nREPL and this one?

See xref:about/history.adoc[our history]. Very simply put - this project is the
continuation of the contrib project. There were several major changes that
happened during the migration:

* The artifact id changed from `org.clojure/clojure.tools.nrepl` to `nrepl/nrepl`.
* The namespace prefix changed from `clojure.tools.nrepl` to `nrepl`.
* The namespace `clojure.tools.nrepl` was renamed to `nrepl.core`.
* Minimal requirements changed from Java 6 and Clojure 1.2 to Java 8 and Clojure 1.7.
* All the code which existed for compatibility with nREPL 0.0.x was removed.

== What's the plural form of "middleware"?

The plural form of "middleware" is "middleware", not "middlewares".footnote:[See https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/257120/middleware-vs-middlewares for a
discussion on the subject] While there's https://www.wordhippo.com/what-is/the-plural-of/middleware.html[some debate] on whether its okay to write something like "a collection of middlewares", we've opted
to stick to using "middleware" everywhere in both the codebase and the documentation.

== Does nREPL support ClojureScript?

Yes, it does, although you'll need additional middleware to enable the
ClojureScript support
(e.g. https://github.com/nrepl/piggieback[piggieback] or
https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs[shadow-cljs]).

== Does nREPL support ClojureCLR?

There is a separate implementation of nREPL for ClojureCLR: https://github.com/clojure/clr.tools.nrepl[https://github.com/clojure/clr.tools.nrepl].

== When is nREPL 1.0 going to be released?

nREPL was released on August 24, 2022. This completes the promise we made
way back in 2018 to address most languishing problems and get nREPL
in a great shape.

Future releases will focus on polishing the nREPL protocol and potentially
adding some https://github.com/nrepl/nrepl/discussions/275[new features].
