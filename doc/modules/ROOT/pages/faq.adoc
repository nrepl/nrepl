== What's the difference between contrib's nREPL and this one?

See xref:about/history.adoc[our history].
Very simply put - this project is the continuation of the contrib project.

== What's the plural form of "middleware"?

The plural form of "middleware" is "middleware", not "middlewares".footnote:[See https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/257120/middleware-vs-middlewares for a
discussion on the subject] While there's https://www.wordhippo.com/what-is/the-plural-of/middleware.html[some debate] on whether its okay to write something like "a collection of middlewares", we've opted
to stick to using "middleware" everywhere in both the codebase and the documentation.

== Does nREPL support ClojureScript?

Yes, it does, although you'll need additional middleware to enable the
ClojureScript support
(e.g. https://github.com/nrepl/piggieback[piggieback] or

way back in 2018 to address most languishing problems and get nREPL
