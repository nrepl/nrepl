= Extensions

Here's a list of notable nREPL extensions (middleware or transports) you might encounter in the wild.

== Official

Official extensions are developed and maintained by nREPL's Core Team and are
hosted under the nREPL GitHub organization.

=== Middleware

==== ClojureScript Support

* https://github.com/nrepl/piggieback[Piggieback]

The following ClojureScript REPLs are leveraging piggieback internally to provide
nREPL support.

* https://github.com/nrepl/weasel[Weasel]
* https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel[figwheel]
* https://github.com/bhauman/figwheel-main[figwheel-main]
* https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs[shadow-cljs] (it actually
only stubs the piggieback API, leverages its own nREPL middleware
internally for ClojureScript evaluation)

=== Transports

==== HTTP Support

* https://github.com/nrepl/drawbridge[drawbridge]

==== Transit Support

* https://github.com/nrepl/fastlane[fastlane]

== Third-party

Third-party extensions are not developed and maintained by nREPL's Core Team and are
hosted outside the nREPL GitHub organization.

=== Middleware

==== Clojure Editor Support

* https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider-nrepl[cider-nrepl]: A collection of nREPL middleware designed to enhance CIDER (and Clojure editors in general).
* https://github.com/clojure-emacs/refactor-nrepl[refactor-nrepl]: A collection of functionality designed to support editor refactoring features.
* https://github.com/liquidz/iced-nrepl[iced-nrepl]: nREPL middleware to support vim-iced.
* https://github.com/nubank/midje-nrepl[midje-nrepl]: nREPL middleware to run Midje tests.

==== Debugging

* https://clojure-emacs.github.io/sayid/[sayid]: A powerful tracing/debugging tool. It is a great alternative of CIDER-nREPL's basic tracing functionality.
* https://github.com/vvvvalvalval/scope-capture-nrepl[scope-capture-nrepl]: A companion library to scope-capture, providing an nREPL middleware that lets you put your REPL in the context of an Execution Point.
