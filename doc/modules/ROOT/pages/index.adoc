== Overview

nREPL is a Clojure **n**etwork REPL that provides a REPL server and
client, along with some common APIs of use to IDEs and other tools
that may need to evaluate Clojure code in remote environments.

== Why nREPL?

nREPL has been designed with the aim of ensuring that it satisfies the
requirements of both application developers (in support of activities ranging
from interactive remote debugging and experimentation in development
contexts through to more advanced use cases such as updating deployed
applications) as well as toolmakers (providing a standard way to connect to and
introspect running environments as a way of informing user interfaces of all
kinds, including "standard" interactive, text-based REPLs).

The default network protocol used is simple, depending neither
on JVM or Clojure specifics, thereby allowing (encouraging?) the development
of non-Clojure REPL clients.  The REPLs operational semantics are such
that essentially any non-JVM Clojure implementation should be able to
implement it, with allowances for hosts that lack the concurrency primitives to
support e.g. asynchronous evaluation, interrupts, etc.

TIP: For more information about the motivation, architecture, use cases, and
discussion related to nREPL, see the original design notes,

around its recent redesign.footnote:[It's not that recent anymore, as the
redesign happened in 2012. It marked the beginning of the long-lived nREPL 0.2 series.]

== Beyond Clojure

While this site is mostly about nREPL's reference (canonical) Clojure implementation,
it's important to point out that the nREPL protocol is language-agnostic and can be
leveraged for many languages that have the ability to evaluate code
at runtime.

One way to describe nREPL would be as something similar in
nature to the link:https://langserver.org/[Language Server Protocol]. nREPL is not nearly as
ambitious as LSP, but on the other hand it's also much simpler and it's trivial to
create nREPL clients in any language.

TIP: You can find some alternative nREPL implementations and more on the subject <<beyond_clojure.adoc,here>>.

== Community-Driven

One of the defining attributes of nREPL is that it's a project built by
the Clojure community for the Clojure community. Making it easy for everyone
interested to participate in the development of nREPL was one of the biggest
reasons why we decided to leave the "Clojure Contrib" umbrella.

Everyone's welcome to get involved in the project, so we can take it to the next level!

== Status

Despite its modest version number, nREPL is extremely stable at this
point. Its communication protocol and API are rock-solid and battle
tested and have been powering much of the existing Clojure tooling for
several years now.footnote:[nREPL had virtually no alternatives before
the introduction of the built-in Socket REPL in Clojure 1.8.]

Given the massive community investment in developing all sorts of
tooling on top of nREPL, nREPL's team pledges to evolve the project only in
a responsible manner and backwards-compatible ways.

NOTE: The migration of nREPL out of Clojure Contrib is probably the
only case where we were forced to make breaking changes.footnote:[Apart
from removing deprecated code that is.] Those are detailed in great
detail <<installation.adoc#upgrading,here>>.
