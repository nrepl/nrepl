  "Middleware that provides printing functionality to other middlewares.

  Returns a handler which transforms any slots specified by

  strings using the provided printing function and options.

  Supports the following options:

  * `::print` – a fully-qualified symbol naming a var whose function to use for
  printing. Must point to a function with signature [value writer options].

  * `::options` – a map of options to pass to the printing function. Defaults to
  `nil`.

  * `::print-fn` – the function to use for printing. In requests, will be
  resolved from the above two options (if provided). Defaults to the equivalent
  of `clojure.core/pr`. Must have signature [writer options].

  * `::stream?` – if logical true, the result of printing each value will be
  streamed to the client over one or more messages.

  * `::buffer-size` – the size of the buffer to use when streaming results.
  Defaults to 1024.

  * `::quota` – a hard limit on the number of bytes printed for each value.

  * `::keys` – a seq of the keys in the response whose values should be printed.

  The options may be specified in either the request or the responses sent on
  its transport. If any options are specified in both, those in the request will
  be preferred."
