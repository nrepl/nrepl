(defn evaluate
  "Evaluates a msg's code within the dynamic context of its session.

   Uses `clojure.main/repl` to drive the evaluation of :code (either a string
   or a seq of forms to be evaluated), which may also optionally specify a :ns
   (resolved via `find-ns`).  The map MUST contain a Transport implementation
   in :transport; expression results and errors will be sent via that Transport.

   Note: we are doubling up on restoring of ctxcl in a `catch` block both here
   and within `misc/with-session-classloader`. Not too sure why this is needed,
   but it does seem to be a fix for https://github.com/nrepl/nrepl/issues/206"
