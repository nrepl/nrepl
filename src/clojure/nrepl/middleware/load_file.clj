;; In this middleware, we implement loading whole the file by nREPL from start
;; to finish. This used to be implemented by calling out to `Compiler/load`.
;; However, `Compiler/load` doesn't allow to customize the evaluation function
;; it uses, so now the middleware is implemented completely by delegating to
;; `interruptible-eval` middleware to do the reading and evaling. All that's
;; left to do here is to make sure that the behavior is still consistent with
;; the old approach.
