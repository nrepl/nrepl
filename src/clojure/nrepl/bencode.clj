;; # Motivation
;;
;; In each and every application, which contacts peer processes via some
;; communication channel, the handling of the communication channel is
;; obviously a central part of the application. Unfortunately introduces
;; handling of buffers of varying sizes often bugs in form of buffer
;; overflows and similar.
;;
;; A strong factor in this situation is of course the protocol which goes
;; over the wire. Depending on its design it might be difficult to estimate
;; the size of the input up front. This introduces more handling of message
;; buffers to accommodate for inputs of varying sizes. This is particularly
;; difficult in languages like C, where there is no bounds checking of array
;; accesses and where errors might go unnoticed for considerable amount of
;; time.
;;
;; To address these issues D. Bernstein developed the so called
;; [netstrings][net]. They are especially designed to allow easy construction
;; of the message buffers, easy and robust parsing.
;;
;; BitTorrent extended this to the [bencode][bc] protocol which also
;; includes ways to encode numbers and collections like lists or maps.
;;
;; *wire* is based on these ideas.

;; # Netstrings
;;
;; Now let's start with the basic netstrings. They consist of a byte count,
;; followed a colon and the binary data and a trailing comma. Examples:
;;
;;     13:Hello, World!,
;;     10:Guten Tag!,
;;     0:,
;;
;; The initial byte count allows to efficiently allocate a sufficiently
;; sized message buffer. The trailing comma serves as a hint to detect
;; incorrect netstrings.
;;
;; ## Low-level reading
;;
;; We will need some low-level reading helpers to read the bytes from
;; the input stream. These are `read-byte` as well as `read-bytes`. They
;; are split out, because doing such a simple task as reading a byte is
;; mild catastrophe in Java. So it would add some clutter to the algorithm
;; `read-netstring`.
;;
;; On the other hand they might be also useful elsewhere.
;;
;; To remove some magic numbers from the code below.

(def ^:const i     105)
(def ^:const l     108)
(def ^:const d     100)
(def ^:const e     101)
(def ^:const comma 44)
(def ^:const minus 45)
(def ^:const colon 58)

;; This function is inline because it is used in a hot loop inside `read-long`.

(definline ^:private read-byte [input]
  ;; There is a quirk here. `.read` returns -1 on end of input. However, the
  ;; Java `byte` has a range from -128 to 127. To accommodate for that, Java
  ;; uses `Byte/toUnsignedInt` which offsets the byte value by 256. The result
  ;; is an `int` that has a range 0-255. Everything below the value 128 stands
  ;; for itself. But larger values are actually negative byte values. We have to
  ;; translate it back here. Narrowing downcast to byte does precisely that.

;; ## Reading a netstring
;;
;; Let's dive straight into reading a netstring from an `InputStream`.
;;
;; For convenience we split the function into two subfunctions. The
;; public `read-netstring` is the normal entry point, which also checks
;; for the trailing comma after reading the payload data with the
;; private `read-netstring*`.
;;
;; The reason we need the less strict `read-netstring*` is that with
;; bencode we don't have a trailing comma. So a check would not be
;; beneficial here.
;;
;; However the consumer doesn't have to care. `read-netstring` as
;; well as `read-bencode` provide the public entry points, which do
;; the right thing. Although they both may reference the `read-netstring*`
;; underneath.
;;
;; With this in mind we define the inner helper function first.

(defn- read-netstring* [input]
  (read-bytes input (read-long input colon)))

;; And the public facing API: `read-netstring`.

(defn read-netstring
  "Reads a classic netstring from input—an InputStream. Returns the
  contained binary data as byte array."
  ^bytes [input]
  (let [content (read-netstring* input)]
    (when-not (= (read-byte input) comma)
      (throw (IOException. "Invalid netstring. ',' expected.")))
    content))

;; Similarly the `string>payload` and `string<payload` functions
;; are defined as follows to simplify the conversion between strings
;; and byte arrays in various parts of the code.

(defn- string>payload ^bytes [^String s]
  (.getBytes s StandardCharsets/UTF_8))

(defn- string<payload ^String [^bytes b]
  (String. b StandardCharsets/UTF_8))

;; ## Writing a netstring
;;
;; This opposite operation – writing a netstring – is just as important.
;;
;; *Note:* We take here a byte array, just as we returned a byte
;; array in `read-netstring`. The netstring should not be concerned
;; about the actual contents. It just sees binary data.
;;
;; Similar to `read-netstring` we also split `write-netstring` into
;; the entry point itself and a helper function.

  (doto output
    (.write (string>payload (str (alength content))))
    (.write (unchecked-int colon))

  netstring."
  [^OutputStream output, content]
  (doto output
    (write-netstring* content)
    (.write (unchecked-int comma))))

;; # Bencode
;;
;; However most of the time we don't want to send simple blobs of data
;; back and forth. The data sent between the communication peers usually
;; have some structure, which has to be carried along the way to the
;; other side. Here [bencode][bc] come into play.
;;
;; Bencode defines additionally to netstrings easily parseable structures
;; for lists, maps and numbers. It allows to communicate information
;; about the data structure to the peer on the other side.
;;
;; ## Tokens
;;
;; The data is encoded in tokens in bencode. There are several types of
;; tokens:
;;
;;  * A netstring without trailing comma for string data.
;;  * A tag specifying the type of the following tokens.
;;    The tag may be one of these:
;;     * `\i` to encode integers.
;;     * `\l` to encode lists of items.
;;     * `\d` to encode maps of item pairs.
;;  * `\e` to end the a previously started tag.
;;
;; ## Reading bencode
;;
;; Reading bencode encoded data is basically parsing a stream of values from the
;; input. To read the bencode encoded data we walk a long the sequence of values
;; and act according to the found tags.

(declare read-bencode)

;; Integers consist of a sequence of decimal digits.

(defn- read-integer [input]
  (read-long input e))

;; Lists are just a sequence of other tokens.

(defn- read-list [input]
  (loop [res (transient [])]
    (if-some [val (read-bencode input)]
      (recur (conj! res val))
      (persistent! res))))

;; Maps are sequences of key/value pairs. The keys are always
;; decoded into strings. The values are kept as is.

(defn- read-map [input]
  (loop [m (transient {})]
    (if-some [key (read-bencode input)]
      (if-some [val (read-bencode input)]
        (recur (assoc! m (string<payload key) val))
        (throw (EOFException. "Invalid bencode map. Unexpected end of input.")))
      (persistent! m))))

;; Note that we use `nil` to represent the terminator read from the input. It is
;; safe because there is no way to encode `nil` into bencode, and thus it is
;; impossible to read `nil` as a legal value out of the stream.

(defn read-bencode
  "Read bencode token from the input stream."
  [^PushbackInputStream input]
  (let [first-byte (read-byte input)]
    (cond (= first-byte i) (read-integer input)
          (= first-byte l) (read-list input)
