(ns nrepl.tls-client-proxy
  "Proxy a local regular TCP connection to a remote TLS TCP connection.
  Can be used if your editor/IDE does not (yet) support TLS connections.

  Example usage:
  $ clojure -Sdeps '{:aliases {:proxy {:deps {nrepl/nrepl {:mvn/version \"1.0.0\"}} :exec-fn nrepl.tls-client-proxy/start-tls-proxy :exec-args {:remote-host \"localhost\" :remote-port 4001 :bind 9001 :tls-keys-file \"client.keys\"}}}}' -T:proxy

  This will start a standalone program that will forward local TCP connections on 127.0.0.1:9001
  to the remote TLS TCP connection at 127.0.0.1:4001 using the key provided in the file `client.keys`."

(defn start-tls-proxy
  "Start a local TLS proxy. This will forward a local regular TCP connection to a remote TLS TCP connection.

  Required options:

  * :remote-host - The host that is hosting a TLS nREPL server
  * :remote-port - The port of the remote host that is hosting a TLS nREPL server
  * One of:
    :tls-keys-file - The TLS certificates and key to use is located in this file
    :tls-keys-str - The TLS certificates and key to use in the form of a string

  Other configuration options include:
  * :port â€” defaults to 0, which autoselects an open port. The port number will be written to :port-file
  * :bind - bind address, by default \"127.0.0.1\"
  * :port-file - where to write the port number. Defaults to \".nrepl-tls-proxy-port\"
  * :connect-timeout-ms - Connection timeout in milliseconds. Defaults to 10000.
  * :block? - Whether to block or not in this function. Defaults to true. For REPL usage/testing you'll want to set this to false.

  Return value:
  If :block? is false, this function will return a state atom. You can stop this server with `(stop! state)`.
  If :block? is true, i.e. the default value, this function will not return (and exit) before the end user presses Ctrl-C."
