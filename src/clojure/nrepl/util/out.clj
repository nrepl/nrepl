(defn wrap-standard-streams
  "Wraps and substitutes `System/out` and `System/err` to enable output
  interception via callbacks. After calling this function:

  1. All output to System/out and System/err will be teed - it goes to both
     the original destinations and triggers any registered callbacks.
  2. The root bindings of *out* and *err* are updated to use the wrapped streams.
  3. clojure.test/*test-out* is also rebound if clojure.test is loaded.

  The wrapping is idempotent - calling this function multiple times has no
  additional effect after the first call. This should typically called once
  during nREPL server initialization to enable output capture for all evaluation
  contexts.

  Note: This makes global changes to the JVM's standard streams that affect
  all threads and code running in the same JVM process."
